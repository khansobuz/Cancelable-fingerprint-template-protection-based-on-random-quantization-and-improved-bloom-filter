# Cancelable-fingerprint-template-protection-based-on-random-quantization-and-improved-bloom-filter

Improving privacy and security in biometric systems requires addressing vulnerabilities in existing 
cancelable fingerprint templates based on bloom filters. Therefore, we propose cancelable fingerprint 
template protection based on random quantization and improved bloom filter. Firstly, random 
quantization entails subtracting a random key from the original fingerprint vector to generate binary 
features, ensuring security, and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, the permutation template mechanism 
rearranges binary features using XOR operations with a security key, enhancing security by concealing 
original information and incorporating additional features. Finally, the improved bloom filter scheme 
ensures robust security for cancelable template protection by integrating sub-block binary conversion 
and Logistic-Tent-Sine (LTTS) random key techniques, guaranteeing the irreversible transformation of 
the original fingerprint template while maintaining high security. The experimental results demonstrate 
the scheme's outstanding accuracy on the FVC2002 and FVC2004 fingerprint databases, establishing it 
as a state-of-the-art solution in fingerprint recognition. Comprehensive security analysis confirms 
compliance with stringent cancelable biometric protection criteria, ensuring superior irreversibility, 
unlinkability, revocability, and privacy against various attacks.
